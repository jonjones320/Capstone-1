#// 1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
            The goal of my website is to provide a welcoming interface for users to explore and 
        track rocket ship launches. Space enthusiasts will be able find upcoming launches, 
        past missions, relevant details, and compile all of their favorite data into an 
        easily accessible list.

#// 2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
#// your users?
            The main demographic of this site will be space enthusiasts--or, more specifically, 
        space enthusiasts who want to have every launch and all relevant data, at their 
        finger tips.
            However, the sky is *not* the limit, when it comes to space exploration; this website's 
        demographic is no different. Any internet user looking for information about rocket
        launches will be thrilled to use this site. 

#// 3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
#// which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
            I will be using The SpaceDev's Launch Library 2.0 API. The Launch Library contains an
        astronomical amount of data, reaching far beyond just rocket launches, but the
        immediate target is to focus on the launch-specific data.


#// 4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
#// know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
#// questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:

    #// a. What does your database schema look like?
            The database will, initially, be two tables: "users" and "launches". The 
        relationships will be one (user) to many (launches), with the "users" table storing 
        the foreign key of the launches they have favorited.

    #// b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
            I will be using the API's free developer key with unlimited rate limits, but it 
        provides "stale and limited data", which leaves the potential for the production
        usage of the site to far eclipse the scope of the development process. Which could
        cause many unforseen problems to arise after app development is finished.
            There is also the potential for the API be intolerably slow with its response 
        times. It was taking as long as 10 seconds to provide a response during my initial 
        testing using Insomnia. A delay in response like that could lead this site to a 
        failure to launch.


    #// c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
            While this site will not be needing information as sensitive as the 
        launch codes, there is the possibility that, in a theoretical production setting,
        this API will need key authentication to access much higher rate limits.


    #// d. What functionality will your app include?
            The functionality of this app will include: creating an account, searching 
        launches and related information, creating lists of launches to have compiled for 
        later. This lists could be things like "Favorite Launches" or "Upcoming Starlink 
        Launches."


    #// e. What will the user flow look like?
            The user flow will start on the homepage with information and graphics from
        the Launch Library API, as well as, options to "login" or "create account". Once 
        a user logs in, or makes an account, they will be redirected to their profile.
        There they will be able to use a search bar to find info about launches and then
        add those launches to their profile in lists.


    #// f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
    #// goals?
            The CRUD elements of my site are: Creating a user, Reading the API 
            request/result data, Updating user information, and Deleting a user. The
            feature allowing users to make lists of favorite launches goes beyond CRUD.
            Additionally, I would like to have graphics or other media displayed 
            correlating to each launch, when possible.
